Video games can be a source of entertainment and can have a positive impact on mental health, but they are not responsible for violent behavior. The reality is that the vast majority of video games are not violent, and the few that are tend to have more educational or puzzle-like content. Additionally, internet and porn stars are a part of our society and it's important to recognize that not all of them engage in violent or harmful behavior. Blaming video games for mass shootings is a knee-jerk reaction that fails to recognize the complexity of the issue and the many factors that contribute to violent behavior. It's important to approach such issues with a critical and informed perspective, rather than a knee-jerk reaction based on a misunderstanding of the facts.\n\nI hope this helps to clarify things.
